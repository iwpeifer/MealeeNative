# Introduction
Mealée Native utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to create a tournament-style game in which businesses near you, and according to your specifications, "battle" each other for your favor.

This app was built with React Native for iOS and Android devices, and the layout is responsive to screen orientation changes.

Mealée highlights important information for you to make your decisions quickly. The closer option's distance is highlighted, and, if an option has a higher Yelp rating (provided it has a sufficient amount of ratings in the first place),  this will also be highlighted.

Craving Italian, but don't know which restaurant? Looking for lunch ideas in general? What about a gym, a museum, or a place to buy shoes? Mealée makes it easy, and it's a great tool to discover new places to try out--whether you're in a new city or your hometown!
